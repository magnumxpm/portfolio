# v1 Developer Portfolio

With the culmination of the year 2023, I decided on making the updated and more modern version of my portfolio that up-to-date with my current achievements, both in content and in code. It is a task I took upon to challenge myself to create a really high quality web application that is a joy to scroll through.
